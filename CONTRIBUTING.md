# Contributing to the Season Club Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Season Club project team! This document outlines how we, as a team, will collaborate on this project. As team members, we share the responsibility to maintain the quality and progress of our project.

## Team Communication

- **Regular Meetings**: We will hold regular meetings (weekly/bi-weekly) to discuss progress,
  challenges and next steps. Attendance is crucial for keeping everyone on the same page.

- **Communication Channels**: Use our designated communication channels (Slack, email, etc.)
  for project-related discussions. This ensures that all team members are informed and can contribute to the conversation.

## Workflow and Tasks

- **Task Assignment**: Tasks will be assigned during our meetings, based on the project's current needs and individual strengths. If you want to take on a specific task, please voice it during the meeting.
- **Progress Updates**: Keep the team updated on your progress. If you are blocked or need assistance, let the team know as soon as possible.

## Development Process

- **Branching Strategy**: Use a consistent branching strategy for our codebase. For example, create a new branch for each feature or bug fix from the `main` branch.
- **Code Standards**: Follow the agreed-upon coding standards and best practices. This includes writing clean, well-documented, and testable code.
- **Peer Reviews**: Before merging any changes, they should be reviewed by at least one other team member. This ensures quality and promotes knowledge sharing.

## Quality Assurance

- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes where applicable. Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date with your changes. This includes both in-code documentation and external documents (like our README).

## Resolving Disputes

- **Open Discussion**: If there are disagreements or different views on a certain aspect of the project, bring them up during our meetings for an open discussion.
- **Team Decision**: Decisions should be made collectively as a team. We value everyoneâ€™s input and aim to reach a consensus that aligns with our project goals.

## Code of Conduct

- **Respect and Inclusion**: Adhere to our Code of Conduct. Respect each other's ideas, contributions, and personal backgrounds.

## Conclusion

Your contributions are vital to the success of the Season Club project. By working together effectively, we can achieve our goals and learn from this experience.
